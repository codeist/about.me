# Who is the Codeist

My name is Jim O'Kelly, and I have been around the programming world for quite a long time now. I have been deeply interested in C, C++, C#, LISP, Ruby, and now GO.

I love functional programming, testing, highly concurrent systems, and cleanly organized code. Oh, and the Ocean. I am fascinated by the great blue yonder and I am an avid sailor.
